  Time series data from scientific fields as diverse as astrophysics, economics, human movement science, and neuroscience all exhibit fractal properties. That is, these time series often exhibit self-similarity and long-range correlations. This `fractalRegression` package implements a number of univariate and bivariate time series tools appropriate for analyzing noisy data exhibiting these properties. These methods, especially the bivariate tools [@kristoufekDetrendedFluctuationAnalysis2015; @likensStatisticalPropertiesMultiscale2019] have yet to be implemented in an open source and complete package for the R Statistical Software environment. As both practitioners and developers of these methods, we expect these tools will be of interest to a wide audience of scientists who use R, especially those from fields such as the human movement, cognitive, and other behavioral sciences. The algorithms have been developed in C++ using the popular Rcpp [@eddelbuettelRcppSeamlessIntegration2011] and RcppArmadillo [@eddelbuettelRcppArmadilloAcceleratingHighperformance2014] packages. The result is a collection of efficient functions that perform well even on long time series (e.g., $\geq$ 10,000 data points). In this work, we motivate introduce the package, each of the functions, and give examples of their use as well as issues to consider to correctly use these methods.

# Introduction

Over time, many signals from living and complex systems exhibit systematic regularities and dependencies across spatial and temporal scales [@kello2010]. These regularities often follow a power-law (i.e., self-similarity across scales) that are estimated using fractal analyses. Fractal analysis, in its many forms, has become an important framework in virtually every area of science, often serving as an indicator of system health [@goldbergerFractalDynamicsPhysiology2002], adaptability [@bakSelforganizedCriticalityExplanation1987], control [@likensExperimentalControlScaling2015], cognitive function [@eulerWorkingMemoryPerformance2016], and multi-scale interactions [@kelty-stephenThreadingMultifractalSocial2017].

In particular, various methods related to Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) [@pengMosaicOrganizationDNA1994] have rose to prominence due to their relative ease of understanding and broad applicability to stationary and non-stationary time series, alike. More specifically, in areas of the social and cognitive sciences, DFA, or variants of DFA, have been used to study, for example, reaction times [@vanordenSelforganizationCognitivePerformance2003], eye gaze [@stephenDynamicsInsightMathematical2009], gait [@hausdorffFractalDynamicsHuman1996, @deligni√®res2009], limb movements [@delignieresFractalModelsEventbased2008], heart rate [@goldbergerFractalDynamicsPhysiology2002], and neurophysiological oscillations [@hardstoneDetrendedFluctuationAnalysis2012, @schaworonkowLongitudinalChangesAperiodic2021, @eulerWorkingMemoryPerformance2016]. And, beyond an individual level, the methods have been used to study human-machine system interaction [@likensExperimentalControlScaling2015], tool use [@kelty-stephenMultifractalTemporalCorrelations2016, @favela2021], and interpersonal coordination in a variety of modalities [@davisMultiscaleInteractionsInterpersonal2016, @delignieresMultifractalSignaturesComplexity2016].

Thus, there is a broad scientific appeal for these fractal-based analyses. While, the basic DFA algorithm has been implemented in numerous packages and software programs, more advanced methods such as Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) [@kantelhardtMultifractalDetrendedFluctuation2002], Detrended Cross Correlation (DCCA) [@zebendeDCCACrosscorrelationCoefficient2011; @podobnikDetrendedCrossCorrelationAnalysis2008], and, in particular, fractal regression techniques such as Multiscale Regression Analysis (MRA) [@kristoufekDetrendedFluctuationAnalysis2015; @likensStatisticalPropertiesMultiscale2019] have not yet been implemented in a comprehensive software package. Thus, there is a clear need for a package that incorporates this functionality in order to advance theoretical research focused on understanding the time varying properties of natural phenomena and applied research that uses those insights in important areas such as healthcare [@cavanaugh2017] and education [@snow2016]. In this work, we provide an overview of our `fractalRegression` package, provide simulated and empirical examples of it's functions, and provide practical advice on the successful application of these methods.

# Package Overview

Our `fractalRegression` package for R [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2018] is built on a C++ architecture and includes a variety of uni- and bivariate fractal methods as well as functions for simulating data with known fractional properties (e.g., scaling, dependence, etc.), and surrogate testing. Some foundational efforts in fractal analyses, which partially overlap with the functionality of this package, have been implemented elsewhere. For example, a number of univariate fractal and multifractal analyses have been implemented in the 'fracLab' library for MATLAB [@legrand2003] and other toolboxes that are mainly targeted at multifractal analysis [@ihlen2010; @ihlenIntroductionMultifractalDetrended2012]. In terms of open access packages, there are other packages that implement some, but not all of the same functions such as the `fathon` package [@bianchi2020] that has been implemented in Python as well as the R packages: `fractal` [defunct], `nonlinearTseries` [@garciaNonlinearTseriesNonlinearTime2020], and `MFDFA` [@laibMultifractalAnalysisTime2018]. However, none of the above packages incorporate univariate monofractal and multifractal DFA with bivariate DCCA and MRA and some are only written in less efficient base R code. Our `fractalRegression` package is unique in this combination of analyses and efficiency (particularly for long time series). For instance, we are not aware of any other packages that feature MRA and Multiscale Lagged Regression (MLRA). In addition, we expect that featuring simulation methods as well as surrogate testing strongly bolsters the accessibility of these methods for the social and cognitive science community in particular, but also science, more generally.

# Methodological Details and Examples

In order to demonstrate the methods within the 'fractalRegression' package, we group this into univariate (DFA, MFDFA) and bivariate methods (DCCA, MRA, MRLA). For each method, we 1) highlight the key question(s) that can be answered with that method, 2) briefly describe the algorithm with references to additional details, 3) describe some key considerations for appropriately applying the algorithm, and demonstrate the use of the functions on a 4) simulated and 5) empirical application of the function. An overview of the functions included in the package, the general objective of that function, and the output are shown below in Table 1. The additional details are included in the sections corresponding to those methods, in the package documentation, and in the original sources for the methods.

## Univariate Methods

### Detrended Fluctuation Analysis

A key question that can be answered by Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) [@pengMosaicOrganizationDNA1994] is: *what is the magnitude and direction of long range correlation in a single time series?* While DFA has been described extensively elsewhere [@kantelhardtDetectingLongrangeCorrelations2001] and visualized nicely [@kelty-stephenMultifractalTemporalCorrelations2016], we provide a brief summary here. DFA entails splitting a time series into several small bins (e.g., 16). In each bin, a least squares regression is fit and subtracted within each window. Residuals are squared and averaged within each window. Then, the square root is taken of the average squared residual across all windows of a given size. This process repeats for larger window sizes, growing by, say a power of 2, up to N/4, where N is the length of the series. In a final step, the logarithm of those scaled root mean squared residuals (i.e., fluctuations) is regressed on the logarithm of window sizes. The slope of this line is termed $\alpha$ and it provides a measure of the long range correlation. $\alpha$ is commonly used an as estimator of the Hurst exponent (H), where $\alpha<1$ = $H$, and for $\alpha>1$, $H = 1 - \alpha$. Conventional interpretation of $\alpha$ is: $\alpha < 0.5$ is anti-correlated, $\alpha ~= 0.5$ is uncorrelated, white noise, $\alpha > 0.5$ is temporally correlated, $\alpha ~= 1$ is long-range correlated, 1/f-noise, pink noise, $\alpha > 1$ is non-stationary where the special case $\alpha ~= 1.5$ is fractional Brownian noise. More generally, $1<\alpha<2$ are referred to as fractional Brownian motion.

#### DFA Examples

To demonstrate the use of `dfa()` we simulate three time series using the `fgn_sim()` function. This is a simple function based on the former `fARMA` R package. It only requires the number of observations `n`, and the Hurst exponent `H`. In particular, we simulate white noise, pink noise, and anti-correlated fractional Gaussian noise using the code below.

```{r, echo = TRUE}

white.noise <- fgn_sim(5000, H = 0.5)

pink.noise <- fgn_sim(n = 5000, H = 0.9)

anti.corr.noise <- fgn_sim(5000, H = 0.25)

scales <- logscale(scale_min = 16, scale_max = 1024, scale_ratio = 2)
```

Then, we run DFA on those simulated series using the example code below. Note that this example uses linear detrending with minimum scale of 16, a maximum scale that is at most 1/4 the time series length, and scale factor (`scale_ratio`) of 2, which is evenly spaced in the logarithmic domain.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
dfa.white <- dfa(x = white.noise, order = 1, verbose = 1, scales=scales, scale_ratio = 2)

dfa.pink <- dfa(x = pink.noise, order = 1, verbose = 1,
scales=scales, scale_ratio = 2)

dfa.anti.corr <- dfa(x = anti.corr.noise, order = 1, verbose = 1, scales=scales, scale_ratio = 2)
```

In terms of output from the above examples, for white noise, we observed that $\alpha$ = `r dfa.white$alpha`, for pink noise we observed that $\alpha$ = `r dfa.pink$alpha`, and since we simulated anti-correlated noise with H = 0.25, we observed a close estimate of the $\alpha$ = `r dfa.anti.corr`\$alpha. In terms of the objects saved from the dfa() function, one commonly inspects the log_scales-log_rms plots. Given the estimates above, we see in Figure 1 that the slopes for white noise, pink noise, and anti-correlated noise conform to our expectations. These slope estimates (and $R^2$) are provided n the equation listed above each respective line, and are generated using the `dfa.plot()` function.

**Figure 1**

*Log scale-Log fluctuation plots for white noise (top), pink noise (middle), and anti-correlated noise (bottom)*

```{r, echo = TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(3,1))
dfa.plot(dfa.white)
dfa.plot(dfa.pink)
dfa.plot(dfa.anti.corr)
```

For an empirical example, we apply the `dfa()` function to the Human Balance Dataset [@santos2016]. This publicly available dataset includes signals from a force platform measured that measures the center of pressure in the x and y dimension for 87 young adults (we exclude the older adults from our analyses for simplicity sake). Trials lasted 60s. See original paper for additional details on data processing [@santos2016]. For the empirical examples, we use two different time series featuring a participant standing on a firm (rigid) surface with eyes open and a foam (unstable) surface with eyes open. Note, however, that we analyze the dataset more fully in INSERT SECTION NAME HERE. We chose this dataset because postural sway data are known to exhibit interesting fractal dynamics [@collins1993 @deligni√®res2011 @delignieresTransitionPersistentAntiPersistent2011] and we can systematically evaluate the data for all of the univariate and bivariate analyses detailed in this work.

For center of pressure (COP) data, we take the first order differences of each series as a rough approximation of COP velocity. For the univariate analyses, we focus on analyses of the COP data in the x dimension. Then, we define the appropriate scales for the analyses.

```{r include=FALSE}
open_firm <- read.csv("./BDS00001.csv")
open_foam <- read.csv("./BDS00007.csv")
open_firm_copx_diff <- diff(open_firm$X.COPx.)
open_firm_copy_diff <- diff(open_firm$X.COPy.)
open_foam_copx_diff <- diff(open_foam$X.COPx.)
open_foam_copy_diff <- diff(open_foam$X.COPy.)
```

**Figure 2**

*Log scale-Log fluctuation plots for empirical difference COPx time series for rigid (left) and unstable (right) surfaces.*

```{r echo=FALSE}
scales <- logscale(scale_min=16, scale_max=length(open_firm_copx_diff)/4,scale_ratio=1.1)

open_firm_copx_diff_dfa <- dfa(open_firm_copx_diff, order = 1, scales=scales, verbose =1)


open_foam_copx_diff_dfa <- dfa(open_foam_copx_diff, order = 1, scales=scales, verbose =1)

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
dfa.plot(open_firm_copx_diff_dfa)
dfa.plot(open_foam_copx_diff_dfa)
```

Importantly, regarding the question one can ask using DFA, we observe from Figure ##, that long range correlations are positive and approximately `r open_firm_copx_diff_dfa$alpha` - `r open_foam_copx_diff_dfa$alpha`. However, from visual inspection of these plots we observe that two slopes might fit better than one for these time series; a phenomenon known as crossovers points [@collins1993 @ge2013]. One common approach when such crossover points exist is to recognize that the signal might be best characterized by two scaling regions, before and after an inflection point. We provide an example of how to check for where the break point is below using piece-wise regression.

```{r}
require(segmented)
dfa.mod <- lm(log_rms~log_scales, data=open_firm_copx_diff_dfa)

seg <- segmented(dfa.mod, seg.Z = ~log_scales)

plot(open_firm_copx_diff_dfa$log_scale,open_firm_copx_diff_dfa$log_rms, pch=16, ylab="logF(s)", xlab = "log(s)")

plot(seg,add=T, lwd=2,col="red")
```

In the example above, we observe a crossover point at around the scale size of log 6. And, from the results in Table 2 below, we observe that there are two distinct scaling relationships corresponding to $\alpha =$ 1.3 and $\alpha =$ 0.42, respectively. This is a well known result in the postural control literature such that short time scales correspond to persistent temporal correlation and the longer time scales correspond to anti-persistent correlation. More substantively, short time scale dynamics correspond to periods of exploratory sway, whereas longer time scales correspond to corrective movements that prevent exceeding the base of support and falling[@collins1993 @deligni√®res2011 @delignieresTransitionPersistentAntiPersistent2011].

### Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis

Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA; @kantelhardtMultifractalDetrendedFluctuation2002) is an extension of DFA by generalizing the fluctuation function to a range of exponents of the $q$th order. The key question that can be answered by MFDFA is: *how does the magnitude and direction of long range correlation change over time within a single time series?* Like DFA, MFDFA entails splitting a time series into several small bins (e.g., 16). In each bin, least squares regression is fit and subtracted within each window. However, the residuals are raised to a range of exponents $q$ and averaged within each window. So when $q = 2$, MFDFA reduces to ordinary DFA. When $q >2$, relatively larger residuals are emphasized and when $q < 2$, relatively smaller residuals are emphasized. The rest of the DFA algorithm is performed for each window and windows size for all values of $q$. We refer the reader to the work of Kelty-Stephens and colleagues @kelty-stephenMultifractalTemporalCorrelations2016 Figure 3 for a visualization of the algorithm and to Kantelhardt and colleagues @kantelhardtMultifractalDetrendedFluctuation2002 for additional mathematical description.

### MFDFA Examples

To demonstrate the use of `mfdfa()`, we work with data included in our package (`fractaldata`), that was originally provided by @ihlenIntroductionMultifractalDetrended2012. It includes a white noise time series, a monofractal time series, and a multifractal time series.

**Figure 3**

*Time series from Ihlen (2012) corresponding to white noise, monofractal, and multifractal series.*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Load the data
data("fractaldata")

white.plot <- ggplot(fractaldata, aes(y=whitenoise, x=time))+geom_line()+ggtitle("White Noise")+ylab("")

mono.plot <- ggplot(fractaldata, aes(y=monofractal, x=time))+geom_line()+ggtitle("Monofractal")+ylab("Amplitude (a.u.)")

multi.plot <- ggplot(fractaldata, aes(y=multifractal, x=time))+geom_line()+ggtitle("Multifractal")+ylab("")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(white.plot,mono.plot,multi.plot,nrow=3)
```

Performing MFDFA is straight forward with the `mfdfa()` function. As shown in the example below, one needs to enter the time series `x` to perform the analysis on, the range of `q` order exponents to use, the `order` of polynomial detrending, and the `scales` for the analysis. In this case, we define our `scales` by choosing logarithmically spaced scales and we select values of q from -5 to 5. Note here that we also who that the scale factor need not be a power of two but should be evenly spaced in the logarithmic domain by, for example, using different logarithm bases. We provide the `logscale` function to facilitate scale construction.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

scales <- logscale(scale_min = 16,scale_max = 1024,scale_ratio = 1.1)

white.mf.dfa.out <- mfdfa(x = fractaldata$whitenoise, q = c(-5:5), order = 1, scales=scales, scale_ratio=1.1)

mono.mf.dfa.out <- mfdfa(x = fractaldata$monofractal, q = c(-5:5), order = 1,  scales=scales, scale_ratio=1.1)

multi.mf.dfa.out <- mfdfa(x = fractaldata$multifractal, q = c(-5:5), order = 1,  scales=scales, scale_ratio=1.1)

```

A common way to understand if there is evidence of multifractality is to examine a plot showing the slopes of the `log_fq` at the `log_scale` values. If all the plots have the same slope, that provides evidence of monofractality. If there are distinct slopes, then there is evidence of multifractality. It's also important to check here that the slopes of `log_scale` and `log_fq` are approximately linear, thus implying that they are scale invariant. If not, then it could be the case that a higher order polynomial detrending is appropriate (see Kantelhardt et al., 2001). Figure 4 shows what we would expect for a monofractal and multifractal signal. In other words, the monofractal signal shows a consistent slope, whereas the multifractal signal shows variability in the slopes.

**Figure 4**

*mfdfa.plots for mono-(top) and multifractal series (bottom). The four panels correspond to DETAILS HERE.*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mfdfa.plot(mono.mf.dfa.out, do.surrogate = FALSE)
mfdfa.plot(multi.mf.dfa.out, do.surrogate = FALSE)
```

A common metric for comparing multifractal spectra is to calculate the width ($W$) as $h_{max} - h_{min}$. Let's do this to compare the monofractal and multifractal time series. We observe in this case that for the monofractal signal $W_{mono} =$ `r max(mono.mf.dfa.out$h) - min(mono.mf.dfa.out$h)` and $W_{multi} =$ `r max(multi.mf.dfa.out$h) - min(multi.mf.dfa.out$h)`. If plot the multifractal spectra D(h) against h, we clearly observe the difference in the widths of the multifractal spectra for the mono- and multifractal signals, as shown in Figure 4 above.

For our empirical analysis, we again turn to the postural data. We set out parameters appropriate for the data and run `mfdfa()`.

```{r}
scales <- logscale(scale_min=16, scale_max=length(open_firm_copx_diff)/4,scale_ratio=1.1)

open_firm_copx_diff_mfdfa <- mfdfa(open_firm_copx_diff, q = -5:5, order = 1, scales=scales, scale_ratio=1.1)

open_foam_copx_diff_mfdfa <- mfdfa(x=open_foam_copx_diff, q = -5:5, order = 1, scales=scales, scale_ratio=1.1)
```

```{r}
mfdfa.plot(open_firm_copx_diff_mfdfa, do.surrogate = FALSE)
mfdfa.plot(open_foam_copx_diff_mfdfa, do.surrogate = FALSE)
```

#### DFA and MFDFA Considerations

We recommend a few points of consideration in using these functions. One is to be sure to evaluate whether there are cross-over points in the log scale-log fluctuation plots [@pengMosaicOrganizationDNA1994; @perakakis2009]. Cross-over points (or a visible change in the slope as a function of scale) indicate that a simple mono-fractal characterization does not sufficiently characterize the data. If cross-over points are evident, we recommend proceeding to estimate the two scaling regions with a piece-wise regression.

While it is common to use only linear detrending with DFA, this is not necessarily best practice. Instead, a more rigorous approach requires inspection trends in the data to determine if a higher order polynomial would be more appropriate for detrending. One can then compare the DFA output for different polynomial orders [@kantelhardtDetectingLongrangeCorrelations2001] to determine if a genuine inflection point is present or if nonlinearity in DFA and MFDFA emerges due to unadressed nonlinear trends in the original series [@likens2019].

General recommendations for choosing the min and max scale are minimum scale of 10 and a maximum scale of N/4, where N is the total number of observations in the signal. See Eke et al. (2002) [@ekeFractalCharacterizationComplexity2002] and Gulich and Zunino (2014) [@gulichCriterionDeterminationOptimal2014] for additional considerations but also keep in mind specific research areas may also have other criteria [@damouras2010 @marmelat2019].

## Bivariate Methods

### Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis

Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA; @podobnikDetrendedCrossCorrelationAnalysis2008, @zebendeDCCACrosscorrelationCoefficient2011 ) is a bivariate extension of the DFA algorithm generalizing it to a correlational case between two time series that may be non-stationary. The key questions that can be asked with it are: a) *How does correlation between two time series change as a function of scale?* and b) *What is/are the dominant (time) scale(s) of coordination?* Such decisions are based on a predetermined threshold such as a conventional statistical significance as we demonstrate below. Researchers may also select other criteria appropriate for their research area.The DCCA algorithm is a direct genralization of the DFA algorithm but applied to two concomitantly measured time series, say *x* and *y*. As in DFA, time series are split into multiple bins and detrended using least squares regression. Separate regressions are performed for *x* and *y*. Within each bin, three quantities are estimated, the average squared residual of *x,* the average squared residual of *y*, and the average cross product (i.e., the covariance) between the residuals for *x* and the residuals for *y*. Each of those quantities is averaged across all bins of a given size. After taking the squared residual for *x* and *y*, we obtain scale-wise equivalents of covariance $F_{xy}(s)$ and standard deviations for *x* $F_x(s)$ and *y* $F_y(s)$. The use of $F$ to designate these quantities derives from originating literature. Thus, the scale-wise regression coefficient, the estimand of DCCA, is nothing more than the following quotient

$$\rho(s)=\frac{F_{xy}(s)}{F_x(s)F_y(s)}$$

Simplified, with DFA, the key metric is $\alpha$, but in DCCA, one estimates the scale-specific, detrended cross-correlation coefficient $\rho(s)$ for the pair of time series.

#### DCCA Examples

To demonstrate the use of `dcca()`, we used the `mc_arfima()` function from our package to simulate two time series with known properties. Specifically, we use the multicorrelated ARFIMA examples from Kristoufek's work [@kristoufekMixedcorrelatedARFIMAProcesses2013]. In this case, we use the parameters from Kristoufek (2013) for Model 1 (p. 6,487), that generates two time series of length 10,000 that exhibit long range correlations (LRC) as well as long range cross-correlations (LRCC). The code for simulating these two time series is shown below. Additionally, Figure #, shown below, visualizes a subset of these time series.

```{r message=FALSE}
set.seed(987345757)

sim1 <- mc_ARFIMA(process="Mixed_ARFIMA_ARFIMA", alpha = 0.2, beta = 1, gamma = 1, delta = 0.2, n = 10000, d1 = 0.4, d2 = 0.3, d3 = 0.3, d4=0.4, rho=0.9)

```

**Figure \#**

*Subset of two time series exhibiting long range correlation and long range cross-correlation*

```{r, echo=FALSE}

plot(sim1[2000:3000,1],type='l', ylab= "Signal Amplitude", xlab='Time', main = "MC-ARFIMA with LRC and LRCC")

lines(sim1[2000:3000,2], col='blue')
```

As can be seen in \hl{Figure **}, the simulated time series, although quite noisy, appear to covary over time with similar trends. To perform the `dcca()` on these time series, we use the code below, where we first define the `scales` using the `logscale()` function described earlier along with the `dcca()` function itself.

```{r}
scales <- logscale(scale_min = 10, scale_max = 1000, scale_ratio = 1.1)

dcca.out.arfima <- dcca(sim1[,1], sim1[,2], order = 1, scales = scales)
```

Next, we visualize the output of DCCA in Figure #. We observe that, as expected, the correlation between the MC-ARFIMA processes are consistently high (all $\rho$'s $> .8$) and continue to be high at increasing time scales.

**Figure \#**

*DCCA output for long range correlation and long range cross-correlation*

```{r, echo=FALSE}

dcca.plot(dcca.out.arfima, order = 1, ci = FALSE, iterations = NULL, return.ci = FALSE)
#dcca.out.arfima <- as.data.frame(dcca.out.arfima)

#error <- sd(dcca.out.arfima$rho)/sqrt(length(dcca.out.arfima$rho))

#dcca.plot <- ggplot(data=dcca.out.arfima, aes(x=scales,y=rho)) + geom_point() +geom_line() + ggtitle("DCCA on MC-ARFIMA processes with LRC and LRCC")+ geom_pointrange(aes(ymin=rho-error,ymax=rho+error))

#geom_smooth(method=lm, formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), se = TRUE)

#dcca.plot
```

Figure \## alone is difficult to interpret on its own. Next we demonstrate additional plot and analysis features of `dcca()` by modifying the above code as shown below by setting. Loess smoothing can also be applied to both $\rho(s)$ and its confidence intervals using `loess.rho = TRUE` and `loess.ci = TRUE`. Those latter options are useful for reducing the impact of increasing variance in estimates of $\rho(s)$ at large scales [@likens2019].

**Figure \#**

*DCCA output for long range correlation and long range cross-correlation*

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dcca.plot(dcca.out.arfima, order = 1, ci = TRUE, iterations = NULL, return.ci = FALSE, loess.rho = TRUE, loess.ci = TRUE)
```

As a point of comparison, we can generate a time series in contrast with this that exhibits processes with LRC and short-range cross-correlation (SRCC) using the code below. In contrast to the previous DCCA analysis, Figure \# shows a signal that begins with a high cross-correlation ($\rho$'s $> .6$) , but that begins to deviate and trend substantially lower at increasing scale sizes approaching $\rho = 0$. In fact, based on the plotted confidence intervals, it is apparent that the correlation between the two series becomes non-significant from a conventional statistical standpoint.

```{r}
sim2 <- mc_ARFIMA(process="Mixed_ARFIMA_AR", alpha = 1,beta = 1,gamma = 1,delta = 1,n =10000,d1=0.4,d2=0.4,theta1=0.8,theta2=0.8,rho=0.9)
```

**Figure \#**

*DCCA output for long range correlation and short range cross-correlation*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
scales <- logscale(scale_min = 10, scale_max = 1000, scale_ratio = 1.1)
dcca.out.arfima2 <- dcca(sim2[,1], sim2[,2], order = 1, scales = scales)
dcca.plot(dcca.out.arfima2, order = 1, ci = TRUE, iterations = NULL, return.ci = FALSE, loess.rho = TRUE, loess.ci = TRUE)

```

Turning next to the empirical balance data, we apply DCCA to the differenced COPx and COPy data for the firm and foam platforms. We again set appropriate values for `scales` and apply the `dcca()` function to the pairs of time series.

```{r echo=FALSE}
scales <- logscale(scale_min=16, scale_max=length(open_firm_copx_diff)/4,scale_ratio=1.1)

dcca.out.open.firm <- dcca(open_firm_copx_diff, open_firm_copy_diff, order = 1, scales = scales)

dcca.out.open.foam <- dcca(open_foam_copx_diff, open_foam_copy_diff, order = 1, scales = scales)

```

**Figure \#**

*DCCA output for empirical COPx and COPy balance data for the eyes open while standing on the firm surface (top) and foam surface (bottom).*

```{r echo=FALSE}
dcca.plot(dcca.out.open.firm, order = 1, ci = TRUE, iterations = NULL, return.ci = FALSE, loess.rho = TRUE, loess.ci = TRUE)

dcca.plot(dcca.out.open.foam, order = 1, ci = TRUE, iterations = NULL, return.ci = FALSE, loess.rho = TRUE, loess.ci = TRUE)

```

In examining the output from these analyses, Figure \# shows a clear difference between the two conditions. First, in the firm platform example, the $\rho(s)$ values reach an order of magnitude greater than in the foam condition with the max $\rho(s)$ = `r max(dcca.out.open.firm$rho)`' compared to `r max(dcca.out.open.foam$rho)` for the foam condition. In addition, we observe for the foam example, that the time scale of maximum correlation is `r dcca.out.open.firm$scales[which.max(dcca.out.open.firm$rho)]`, which is a larger time scale when compared to the foam example, which had a maximum correlation at scale r `dcca.out.open.foam$scales[which.max(dcca.out.open.foam$rho)]`. In addition, the pattern of change in correlation across scales is slightly different. Th firm example is higher overall, it starts relatively low at very small time scales before a rapid increase and then steady decrease before exhibiting some pseudo-periodic behavior at increasingly larger scales. By contrast, the foam example has relatively lower overall correlation values, the smallest scale is the highest followed by a steady decrease and then also some pseudo-periodic behavior at increasingly larger scales. Lastly, we can also derive statistical conclusions because, in the firm condition, the two series are correlated at all scales, whereas the series are only correlated at the finest scales in the foam condition.

### Multiscale Regression Analysis

Multiscale regression analysis (MRA) is an adaptation of DCCA that brings the analyses into a predictive, regression framework [@kristoufek2015]. The key questions that can be answered by it are: a) *How does the influence of one time series on another time series change as a function of scale?* and b) *What is/are the dominant (time) scale(s) of influence of one time series on another time series?* The algorithm is largely the same as DCCA, with a key difference being that instead of estimating scale-wise symmetric correlation coefficients, leveraging methods of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, asymmetric $\beta$ coefficients are estimated (see @likens2019; @kristoufek2015 ) according to the following equation

$$
\beta(s)=\frac{F_{xy}(s)}{F^2_x(s)}
$$

The $\beta(s)$ equation differs from the $\rho(s)$ equation only in the denominator where $F^2_x(s)$ is the average squared residual at each scale and $F_xy(s)$ is still the scale-wise covariance.

#### MRA Examples

Considering the LRC and LRCC simulations used for DCCA, we can examine whether the scale-wise fluctuations of one variable can predict the scale-wise fluctuations of the other using `mra()`. As with a traditional regression approach, we will use one of our variables as our predictor ($x_t$) and the other as our outcome ($y_t$). In the example below, we again first define our logarithmically spaced scales. We then apply the `mra()` function to the two simulated time series. In this case, it's important to specify which is variable is `x` (the predictor) and which is `y` (the outcome).

```{r}
scales <- logscale(scale_min = 10, scale_max = 1000, scale_ratio = 1.1)

mra.out <- mra(x = sim1[,1], y = sim1[,2],order = 1, scales = scales)
```

We can then visualize these results as shown below in Figure #. Generally, we observe that the $\beta$ coefficients are relatively stable at increasing time scales with a general, perhaps quadratically increasing trend. Here it is also important to investigate the change in $R^2$ as well as the $t$-values. Below we see that the $R^2$ is quite high at most of the time scales with $R^2_{min} =$ `r round(min(mra.out$r2),2)` and $R^2_{max} =$ `r round(max(mra.out`\$r2),2) and all $\beta(s)$ exceed the confidence intervals, implying conventional statistical significance. So between these two component ARFIMA processes, the output of MRA shows that much of the scale specific variance in $y_t$ is explained and predicted by $x_t$.

**Figure \#**

*MRA output for long range correlation and long range cross-correlation.*

```{r echo=FALSE}
mra.plot(mra.out, order = 1, ci = TRUE, iterations = NULL, return.ci = FALSE, loess.beta = TRUE, loess.ci = TRUE)

```

```{r warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
scales <- logscale(scale_min = 16, scale_max = length(open_firm_copx_diff)/4, scale_ratio = 1.1)

mra.firm.out.xy <- mra(open_firm_copx_diff, open_firm_copy_diff, order = 1, scales = scales)

mra.firm.out.yx <- mra(open_firm_copy_diff, open_firm_copx_diff, order = 1, scales = scales)
#open_foam_copx_diff, open_foam_copy_diff

```

Turning next to the empirical balance data, we can determine whether postural adjustments in the COPx are predictive of adjustments in COPy, and vice versa. This means that we use the `mra()` function two times and reverse the order of entry for the x and y arguments to allow for determining the degree to which each signal can predict the other across scales. In Figure \# below, we see the resulting $\beta$'s we observed for the the balance data on the firm surface. Notably, the COPx predicting COPy (max $\beta$ = `r max(mra.firm.out.xy$betas)`) has noticeably smaller $\beta$ values compared to COPy predicting COPx (max $\beta$ = `r max(mra.firm.out.yx$betas)`). Notice as well how Figure \# (bottom), where adjustments in the y dimension are predicting adjustments in the x dimension, resembles the DCCA plot for this analysis (see Figure \#). Given the assymetry in the magnitude of the $\beta$s, this example suggests that postural adjustments in the y dimension appear to be driving changes in the x dimension. And, there is a clear time scale where this relationship is strongest at scales = `r mra.firm.out.yx$scales[which.max(mra.firm.out.yx$betas)]`, implying a dominant mode of coordination between mediolateral and anterioposterior control processes.

**Figure \#**

*MRA output for balance data on foam surface with COPx predicting COPy (top) and COPy predicting COPx (bottom).*

```{r echo=FALSE}
mra.plot(mra.firm.out.xy, order = 1, ci = TRUE, iterations = NULL, return.ci = FALSE, loess.beta = TRUE, loess.ci = TRUE)
mra.plot(mra.firm.out.yx, order = 1, ci = TRUE, iterations = NULL, return.ci = FALSE, loess.beta = TRUE, loess.ci = TRUE)
```

### Multiscale Lagged Regression Analysis

Multiscale lagged regression analysis is an extension of MRA that allows for examining the influence as a function of scale, but also of time lag. In particular, the key questions that can be asked with MLRA are: a) *How does the influence of one time series on another time series change as a function of scale at different time lags?* and b) *Does the dominant time scale of influence change over successive time lags?* The MLRA algorithm performs the same as MRA with a key distinction. It runs the MRA algorithm for each of a desired number of lags.

#### MLRA Examples

We demonstrate the use of MLRA on a simple two-element system

$$
y(t)=1+0.0y(t-50)+1.0x(t-50)+e_1(t)
$$

$$
x(t)=1+0.0y(t-50)+0.0x(t-50)+e_1(t)
$$ In the above system, $y(t)$ is coupled to $x(t)$ at lag 50 but $x(t)$ is not coupled to $y(t)$. In Figure #, we see the output of MLRA when regressing $y(t)$ on $x(t)$.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
e1 = rnorm(1000)
e2 = rnorm(1000)
x = 1 + e1
y = rep(0, length(e2))
for (t in 51:length(x)){
  y[t] = 1 + 0.0*y[t-50] + 1.0*x[t-50] + e2[t]
  # x[t] = 1 + 0.0*y[t-50] + 0.0*x[t-50] + e2[t]
}
x = x[51:length(x)]
y = y[51:length(y)]
scales = seq(10, 50, by = 5)
mlra.out = mlra(x, y, order = 1, scales = scales, lags = 100,'n')

breaks = 101

fields::image.plot(x = 0:100, y = scales, z = mlra.out$betas,
                   xlab = 'Lag', ylab = 'Scale')
```

In terms of the empirical data, below we apply the MLRA to the COPxy data for the firm and the foam examples. We investigate up to a lag of 100.

**Figure \#**

*MLRA output for balance data on foam surface with COPx predicting COPy for the firm (top) and foam (bottom) examples.*

```{r, echo=FALSE}

scales <- logscale(scale_min = 16, scale_max = length(open_firm_copx_diff)/4, scale_ratio = 1.1)
mlra.firm.out <- mlra(scale(open_firm_copy_diff), scale(open_firm_copx_diff),order = 1, scales = scales, lags = 100, direction = 'p')
x <- 0:100
y <- scales
fields::image.plot(x, y, mlra.firm.out$betas, axes=TRUE, legend.lab = "Beta Coefficient", ylab="Scale", xlab="Lag", main="MLRA on COPxy firm")

scales <- logscale(scale_min = 16, scale_max = length(open_foam_copx_diff)/4, scale_ratio = 1.1)
mlra.foam.out <- mlra(scale(open_foam_copy_diff), scale(open_foam_copx_diff),order = 1, scales = scales, lags = 100, direction = 'p')
x <- 0:100
y <- scales
fields::image.plot(x, y, mlra.foam.out$betas, axes=TRUE, legend.lab = "Beta Coefficient", ylab="Scale", xlab="Lag", main="MLRA on COPxy foam")


```

## Surrogate Methods

In all of the above methods, one gets either a single estimate of a parameter (e.g., $\alpha$) or a range of estimates (e.g., $\rho(s)$, $\beta(s)$). While those estimates are meaningful in and of themselves, it is common practice to perform some form of null hypothesis test regarding the estimate. These are generally referred to as surrogate methods @kantz2003 . We present several options here that could be ranked in terms of increasing levels of rigor: randomized surrogates, iterative amplitude adjusted Fourier transformed (IAAFT) surrogates, and model based surrogates.

### Randomized Surrogates

Randomized surrogates generally involve randomly shuffling the order of values of a time series. The idea is generally that the temporal structure is destroyed, yet the other features of the time series still exist [@kantelhardtMultifractalDetrendedFluctuation2002]. Note that additional options exist along these lines (see for example [@dumasInterBrainSynchronizationSocial2010]). The key comparison here would be to compare the estimates extracted from a given analysis (e.g., DFA) on the observed sample of data with the estimates derived from and equally sized sample of the surrogate series (see @kantz2003 @moulder2018 @wiltshire2019 for examples).

```{r}
rand.surr <- permute::shuffle(pink.noise)

dfa.rand.surr <- dfa(x = rand.surr, order = 1, verbose = 1, scales = scales, scale_ratio = 2)
```

Randomizing the pink noise time series, which originally exhibited long range correlation ($\alpha$ = `r dfa.pink$alpha`), and performing DFA on it, now provides an estimate of $\alpha$ = `r dfa.rand.surr$alpha`, which is consistent with a random or white noise process. These values are clearly different, however, performing inferential statistics on a sample of observed estimates compared to surrogate estimates would provide compelling evidence that the temporal dynamics suggested by the observed estimates are different than those derived from a random process.

### Iterative Amplitude-Adjusted Fourier Transform Surrogates (IAAFT)

The IAAFT algorithm was originally developed as a way to be able to evaluate, whether there is nonlinearity [@schreiber1996]. More recently, it was proposed as a technique that could be use to see whether multifractal indices suggest interaction across scales [@ihlen2010]. Like with randomized shuffling, estimates derived from IAAFT surrogates should be also be different from the estimates derived from the empirical time series. Although in this case, the comparison is typically made between the multifractal spectra of the observed time series, and the spectra from a set of IAAFT surrogate series.

In the code below, we provide an example for generating IAAFT surrogates using the `iaafft()` function in the package. One enters the `signal`, which is the observed time series, and `N`, the number of surrogates to generate. There are a number of options here but a common number of surrogates is 19 [@kantz2003]. Common practice is that surrogates are generated from many observed time series, but here we illustrate using only a single time series: the multifractal signal used previously in the MFDFA example. Then we use the same parameters for the `mfdfa()` function, but apply it to all of the IAAFFT surrogates.

```{r}

iaafft.surr <- iaafft(fractaldata$multifractal, N = 19)

iaafft.surr.out <- apply(iaafft.surr, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mfdfa, q = c(-5:5), order = 1, scales=scales)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# maybe there is a more efficient way to do this with apply?
for (i in 1:length(iaafft.surr.out)){
  mf.width.temp <- max(iaafft.surr.out[[i]]$h) - min(iaafft.surr.out[[i]]$h)
  if (i == 1){
    mf.width <- mf.width.temp
  } else {
    mf.width <- rbind(mf.width,mf.width.temp)
  }
}
```

Assuming we were using IAAFFT to compare the multifractal width ($W$) between the observed signal and the surrogate signals, recall that the observed widith was $W_{multi} =$ `r max(multi.mf.dfa.out$h) - min(multi.mf.dfa.out$h)`. Now, we can calculate the average multifractal width across all of the generated surrogates and we observe that $W_{surr} =$ `r mean(mf.width)`, which is narrower than the spectrum from the multifractal signal. In practice, there are many surrogate options [@moulder2018], but, again, inferential statistics are commonly performed to compare observed estimates to the surrogate estimates to bolster evidence of the inferred dynamics.

### Model-based Surrogates

-   Model based surrogate (Simulated exponents) - See Likens 2019 paper with model of postural sway/control, taking an educated guess about the data generating process underlying the time series. Estimates should not be different. See Roume et al 2018 windowed detrended CCA
-   Can we incorporate lags into MC-ARFIMA?

# Appendix 1: Fundamental Equations

Here we will insert the fundamental equations for showcasing the algorithms. WE NEED Lagged functions and MFDFA.

DFA

$F_X = \sqrt{\frac{\sum^{T-s+1}_{j-1}f^2_X(s,j)}{T-s}}$

where

$f^2_X(s,j) = \frac{\sum^{j+s-1}_{k=j}(X_k -\widehat{X}_{k,j})}{s-1}$

DCCA

$F_Y = \sqrt{\frac{\sum^{T-s+1}_{j-1}f^2_Y(s,j)}{T-s}}$

where

$f^2_Y(s,j) = \frac{\sum^{j+s-1}_{k=j}(Y_k -\widehat{Y}_{k,j})}{s-1}$

and the scale-wise covariance is estimated as:

$f^2_{XY}(s,j) = \frac{\sum^{j+s-1}_{k=j}(X_k -\widehat{X}_{k,j})(Y_k -\widehat{Y}_{k,j})}{s-1}$

which forms the basis for the scale-wise correlation coefficient estimated as:

$\rho(s) = \frac{F^2_{XY}(s)}{F_X(s)F_Y(s)}$

and for the multi-scale regression coefficients, we replace the denominator in the $\rho(s)$ equation with scale-wise variance of the predictor to estimate the scale-wise regression coefficient from regression $Y_t$ on $X_t$ as:

$\widehat{\beta}(s) = \frac{F^2_{XY}(s)}{F^2_X(s)}$

and where the variance of $\widehat{\beta}(s)$ is:

$\sigma_{\widehat{\beta}(s)}^2 = \frac{1}{T-2} \times \frac{F^2_u(s)}{F^2_Y(s)}$

and the scale-wise residual variance, $\widehat{F}^2_u(s)$ is estimated by applying the DFA algorithm to all scale-wise residuals, $\widehat{u}_t(s)$ as:

$\widehat{u}_t(s) = y_t - x_t\widehat{\beta}(s) - \overline{y_t - x_t\widehat{\beta}(s)}$

# Introduction

Over time, many signals from living and complex systems exhibit systematic regularities and dependencies across spatial and temporal scales [@kello2010; @diniz2011]. These regularities often follow a power-law (i.e., self-similarity in statistical properties across temporal scales) that are estimated using fractal analyses. Fractal analysis, in its many forms, has become an important framework in virtually every area of science, often serving as an indicator of system health [@goldbergerFractalDynamicsPhysiology2002], adaptability [@bakSelforganizedCriticalityExplanation1987], control [@likensExperimentalControlScaling2015], cognitive function [@eulerWorkingMemoryPerformance2016], and multi-scale interactions [@kelty-stephenThreadingMultifractalSocial2017].

In particular, various methods related to Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) [@pengMosaicOrganizationDNA1994] have rose to prominence due to their relative ease of understanding and broad applicability to stationary and non-stationary time series, alike. More specifically, in areas of the social and cognitive sciences, DFA, or variants of DFA, have been used to study, for example, reaction times [@vanordenSelforganizationCognitivePerformance2003], eye gaze [@stephenDynamicsInsightMathematical2009], gait [@hausdorffFractalDynamicsHuman1996, @deligni√®res2009], limb movements [@delignieresFractalModelsEventbased2008], heart rate [@goldbergerFractalDynamicsPhysiology2002], and neurophysiological oscillations [@hardstoneDetrendedFluctuationAnalysis2012, @schaworonkowLongitudinalChangesAperiodic2021, @eulerWorkingMemoryPerformance2016]. And, beyond an individual level, the methods have been used to study human-machine system interaction [@likensExperimentalControlScaling2015], tool use [@kelty-stephenMultifractalTemporalCorrelations2016, @favela2021], and interpersonal coordination in a variety of modalities [@davisMultiscaleInteractionsInterpersonal2016, @delignieresMultifractalSignaturesComplexity2016; @likens2014].

Thus, there is a broad scientific appeal for these fractal-based analyses. While, the basic DFA algorithm has been implemented in numerous packages and software programs, more advanced methods such as Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) [@kantelhardtMultifractalDetrendedFluctuation2002], Detrended Cross Correlation (DCCA) [@zebendeDCCACrosscorrelationCoefficient2011; @podobnikDetrendedCrossCorrelationAnalysis2008], and, in particular, fractal regression techniques such as Multiscale Regression Analysis (MRA) [@kristoufekDetrendedFluctuationAnalysis2015; @likensStatisticalPropertiesMultiscale2019] have not yet been implemented in a comprehensive software package. Thus, there is a clear need for a package that incorporates this functionality in order to advance theoretical research focused on understanding the time varying properties of natural phenomena and applied research that uses those insights in important areas such as healthcare [@cavanaugh2017] and education [@snow2016]. In this work, we provide an overview of our `fractalRegression` package, provide simulated and empirical examples of it's functions, and provide practical advice on the successful application of these methods.

# Package Overview

Our `fractalRegression` package for R [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2018] is built on a C++ architecture and includes a variety of uni- and bivariate fractal methods as well as functions for simulating data with known fractional properties (e.g., scaling, dependence, etc.), and surrogate testing[@schreiber1996]. Some foundational efforts in fractal analyses, which partially overlap with the functionality of this package, have been implemented elsewhere. For example, a number of univariate fractal and multifractal analyses have been implemented in the 'fracLab' library for MATLAB [@legrand2003] and other toolboxes that are mainly targeted at multifractal analysis [@ihlen2010; @ihlenIntroductionMultifractalDetrended2012]. In terms of open access packages, there are other packages that implement some, but not all of the same functions such as the `fathon` package [@bianchi2020] that has been implemented in Python as well as the R packages: `fractal` [defunct], `nonlinearTseries` [@garciaNonlinearTseriesNonlinearTime2020], and `MFDFA` [@laibMultifractalAnalysisTime2018]. However, none of the above packages incorporate univariate monofractal and multifractal DFA with bivariate DCCA and MRA and most run on a base R architecture without the performance boost of C++. Our `fractalRegression` package is thus unique in this combination of analyses and efficiency (particularly for long time series). For instance, we are not aware of any other packages that feature MRA and Multiscale Lagged Regression (MLRA) [@kristoufek2015];@likens2019]. In addition, we expect that featuring simulation methods as well as surrogate testing enhances the accessibility of these methods for our target audience (viz. social and cognitive scientists) while also appealing to the general scientific community.

# Methodological Details and Examples

The following demonstration of the `fractalRegression` package is grouped in into univariate (DFA, MFDFA) and bivariate methods (DCCA, MRA, MRLA). For each method, we 1) propose key question(s) that can be answered with each method, 2) briefly describe the algorithm with originating sources for additional details, 3) describe practical considerations for appropriately applying the algorithm, and 4) demonstrate the use of the functions on simulated and empirical data. An overview of the functions included in the package, the general objective of that function, and the output are shown below in Table 1. Additional details are included in the sections corresponding to each method, in the package documentation, and in the original sources for the methods.

## Univariate Methods

### Detrended Fluctuation Analysis

The key question that can be answered by Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) [@pengMosaicOrganizationDNA1994] is: *what is the magnitude and direction of long range correlation in a single time series?* While DFA has been described extensively elsewhere [@kantelhardtDetectingLongrangeCorrelations2001] and visualized nicely [@kelty-stephenMultifractalTemporalCorrelations2016], we provide a brief summary here. DFA entails splitting a time series into several small bins (e.g., 16). In each bin, the least squares regression is fit and subtracted within each window. Residuals are squared and averaged within each window. Then, the square root is taken of the average squared residual across all windows of a given size. This process repeats for larger window sizes, growing by, say a power of 2, up to N/4, where N is the length of the series. In a final step, the logarithm of those scaled root mean squared residuals (i.e., fluctuations) is regressed on the logarithm of window sizes. The slope of this line is termed $\alpha$ and provides a measure of the long range correlation. $\alpha$ is commonly used an as estimator of the Hurst exponent (H), where $\alpha<1$ = $H$, and for $\alpha>1$, $H = \alpha$ -1. Conventional interpretation of $\alpha$ is: $\alpha < 0.5$ is anti-correlated, $\alpha ~= 0.5$ is uncorrelated, white noise, $\alpha > 0.5$ is temporally correlated, $\alpha ~= 1$ is long-range correlated (aka 1/f-noise, pink noise), $\alpha > 1$ is non-stationary fractional Brownian motion. The special case where $\alpha ~= 1.5$ is ordinary Brownian motion.

#### DFA Examples

To demonstrate the use of `dfa(),` we simulate three time series using the `fgn_sim()` function that is ultimately based on the Davies-Hart algorithm [@davies1987; @beran1994]. This is a simple function derived from the now-defunct `fARMA` R package. The only inputs required are the number of observations `n`, and the Hurst exponent `H`. Here, we simulate white noise, pink noise, and anti-correlated fractional Gaussian noise using the code below. We also create a vector scales that we wish to use in subsequent DFA calculations.

```{r, echo = TRUE}

white.noise <- rnorm(5000)

pink.noise <- fgn_sim(n = 5000, H = 0.9)

anti.corr.noise <- fgn_sim(5000, H = 0.25)

scales <- logscale(scale_min = 16, scale_max = 1024, scale_ratio = 2)
```

Next, we run DFA on those simulated series using the example code below. Note that this example uses a linear detrending with minimum scale of 16, a maximum scale that is at most 1/4 the time series length, and logarithmically spaced scale factor (`scale_ratio`) of 2.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
dfa.white <- dfa(x = white.noise, order = 1, verbose = 1, scales=scales, scale_ratio = 2)

dfa.pink <- dfa(x = pink.noise, order = 1, verbose = 1,
scales=scales, scale_ratio = 2)

dfa.anti.corr <- dfa(x = anti.corr.noise, order = 1, verbose = 1, scales=scales, scale_ratio = 2)
```

In terms of output from the above examples, for white noise, we observed that $\alpha$ = `r dfa.white$alpha`, for pink noise we observed that $\alpha$ = `r dfa.pink$alpha`, and since we simulated anti-correlated noise with H = 0.25, we observed a close estimate of the $\alpha$ = `r dfa.anti.corr$alpha`. In terms of the objects saved from the `dfa()` function, one commonly inspects the `log_scales`-`log_rms` plots. Given the estimates above, we see in Figure 1 that the slopes for white noise, pink noise, and anti-correlated noise conform to our expectations (i.e., linear in the log-log domain). These slope estimates are provided n the equation listed above each respective line, and are generated using the `dfa.plot()` function.

**Figure 1**

*Log scale-Log fluctuation plots for white noise (top), pink noise (middle), and anti-correlated noise (bottom)*

```{r, echo = TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(3,1))
dfa.plot(dfa.white)
dfa.plot(dfa.pink)
dfa.plot(dfa.anti.corr)
```

For an empirical example, we apply the `dfa()` function to the Human Balance Dataset [@santos2016]. For our purpose, this publicly available dataset includes signals from a force platform that measure the center of pressure in the x and y dimension for 87 young adults (we exclude the older adults for our analyses). Trials lasted 60s. See original paper for additional details on data processing [@santos2016]. For the empirical examples, we use two different time series featuring a participant standing on a firm (rigid) surface with eyes open and a foam (unstable) surface with eyes open. Here, we only analyze single time series but demonstrate a complete worked out example with all 87 subject in INSERT SECTION NAME HERE. We chose this dataset because postural sway data are known to exhibit interesting fractal dynamics [@collins1993; @delignieresTransitionPersistentAntiPersistent2011], and we can systematically evaluate the data for all of the univariate and bivariate analyses detailed in this work.

For the center of pressure (COP) data, we take the first order differences of each series. For the univariate analyses, we focus on analyses of the COP data in the x dimension. Then, we define the appropriate scales for the analyses.

```{r include=FALSE}
open_firm <- read.csv("BDS00001.csv")
open_foam <- read.csv("BDS00007.csv")
open_firm_copx_diff <- diff(open_firm$COPx.cm.)
open_firm_copy_diff <- diff(open_firm$COPy.cm.)
open_foam_copx_diff <- diff(open_foam$COPx.cm.)
open_foam_copy_diff <- diff(open_foam$COPy.cm.)
```

**Figure 2**

*Log scale-Log fluctuation plots for empirical difference COPx time series for rigid (left) and unstable (right) surfaces.*

```{r echo=FALSE}
scales <- logscale(scale_min=16, scale_max=length(open_firm_copx_diff)/4,scale_ratio=1.1)

open_firm_copx_diff_dfa <- dfa(open_firm_copx_diff, order = 1, scales=scales, verbose =1)


open_foam_copx_diff_dfa <- dfa(open_foam_copx_diff, order = 1, scales=scales, verbose =1)

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
dfa.plot(open_firm_copx_diff_dfa)
dfa.plot(open_foam_copx_diff_dfa)
```

Importantly, regarding the question one can ask using DFA, we observe from Figure ##, that long range correlations are positive and approximately `r open_firm_copx_diff_dfa$alpha` - `r open_foam_copx_diff_dfa$alpha`. However, from visual inspection of these plots we observe that two slopes might fit better than one for these time series; a phenomenon known as crossovers points [@ge2013]. One common approach when such crossover points exist is to recognize that the signal might be best characterized by two scaling regions up to a particular time scale. We provide an example of how to check for where the break point is below using piece-wise regression.

```{r}
require(segmented)
dfa.mod <- lm(log_rms~log_scales, data=open_firm_copx_diff_dfa)

seg <- segmented(dfa.mod, seg.Z = ~log_scales)

plot(open_firm_copx_diff_dfa$log_scale,open_firm_copx_diff_dfa$log_rms, pch=16, ylab="logF(s)", xlab = "log(s)")

plot(seg,add=T, lwd=2,col="red")
```

In the example above, we observe that the is a crossover point at around the scale size of log 6. And, from the results in Table 2 below, we osberve that there are two distinct scaling relationships of $\alpha =$ 1.3 and $\alpha =$ 0.42, respectively. The postural control literature has shown evidence of this type of dynamic before with short time scales displaying more DESCRIBE and longer time scale exhibiting DESCRIBE (CITE).

### Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis

Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA; @kantelhardtMultifractalDetrendedFluctuation2002) is an extension of DFA by generalizing the fluctuation function to a range of exponents of the $q$th order. The key question that can be answered by MFDFA is: *how does the magnitude and direction of long range correlation change over time within a single time series?* Like DFA, MFDFA entails splitting a time series into several small bins (e.g., 16). In each bin, the least squares regression is fit and subtracted within each window. However, the residuals are raised to a range of exponents $q$ and averaged within each window. So when $q = 2$, DFA is equal to MFDFA. When $q >2$, larger residual are emphasized and when $q < 2$, smaller residuals are emphasized. The rest of the DFA algorithm is performed for each window and windows size for all values of $q$. We refer the reader to the work of Kelty-Stephens and colleagues @kelty-stephenMultifractalTemporalCorrelations2016 Figure 3 for a visualization of the algorithm and to Kantelhardt and colleagues @kantelhardtMultifractalDetrendedFluctuation2002 for additional mathematical description.

### MFDFA Examples

To demonstrate the use of `mfdfa()`, we work with data included in our package (`fractaldata`), that was originally provided by @ihlenIntroductionMultifractalDetrended2012 . It includes a white noise time series, monofractal time series, and a multifractal time series.

**Figure 3**

*Time series from Ihlen (2012) corresponding to white noise, monofractal, and multifractal series.*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Load the data
data("fractaldata")

white.plot <- ggplot(fractaldata, aes(y=whitenoise, x=time))+geom_line()+ggtitle("white noise")+ylab("signal amplitude")

mono.plot <- ggplot(fractaldata, aes(y=monofractal, x=time))+geom_line()+ggtitle("monofractal")+ylab("signal amplitude")

multi.plot <- ggplot(fractaldata, aes(y=multifractal, x=time))+geom_line()+ggtitle("multifractal")+ylab("signal amplitude")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(white.plot,mono.plot,multi.plot,nrow=3)
```

Performing MF-DFA is relatively straight forward with the `mfdfa()` function. As shown in the example below, one needs to enter the time series `x` to perform the analysis on, the range of `q` order exponents to use, the `order` of polynomial detrending, and the `scales` for the analysis. In this case, we define our `scales` by choosing logarithmically spaced scales and we select values of q from -5 to 5.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

scales <- logscale(scale_min = 16,scale_max = 1024,scale_ratio = 1.1)

white.mf.dfa.out <- mfdfa(x = fractaldata$whitenoise, q = c(-5:5), order = 1, scales=scales, scale_ratio=1.1)

mono.mf.dfa.out <- mfdfa(x = fractaldata$monofractal, q = c(-5:5), order = 1,  scales=scales, scale_ratio=1.1)

multi.mf.dfa.out <- mfdfa(x = fractaldata$multifractal, q = c(-5:5), order = 1,  scales=scales, scale_ratio=1.1)

```

A common way to understand if there is evidence of multifractality is to examine a plot showing the slopes of the `log_fq` at the `log_scale` values. If all the plots have the same slope, that provides evidence of monofractality. If there are distinct slopes, then there is evidence of multifractality. It's also important to check here that the slopes of `log_scale` and `log_fq` are largely linear, thus implying that they are scale invariant. If not, then it could be the case that a higher order polynomial detrending is appropriate (see Kantelhardt et al., 2001). Figure 4 shows what we would expect for a monofractal and multifractal signal. In other words, the monofractal signal shows a consistent slope, whereas the multifractal signal shows variability in the slopes.

**Figure 4**

*mfdfa.plots for mono-(top) and multifractal series (bottom). The four panels correspond to DETAILS HERE.*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mfdfa.plot(mono.mf.dfa.out)
mfdfa.plot(multi.mf.dfa.out)
```

A common metric for comparing the multifractal spectrum is to calculate the width ($W$) as $h_{max} - h_{min}$. Let's do this to compare the monofractal and multifractal time series. We observe in this case that for the monofractal signal $W_{mono} =$ `r max(mono.mf.dfa.out$h) - min(mono.mf.dfa.out$h)` and $W_{multi} =$ `r max(multi.mf.dfa.out$h) - min(multi.mf.dfa.out$h)`. If plot the multifractal spectra D(h) against h, we clearly observe the difference in the widths of the multifractal spectra for the mono- and multifractal signals, as shown in Figure 4 above.

For our empirical analysis, we again turn to the postural data. We set out parameters appropriate for the data and run `mfdfa()`.

```{r}
scales <- logscale(scale_min=16, scale_max=length(open_firm_copx_diff)/4,scale_ratio=1.1)

open_firm_copx_diff_mfdfa <- mfdfa(open_firm_copx_diff, q = -5:5, order = 1, scales=scales, scale_ratio=1.1)

open_foam_copx_diff_mfdfa <- mfdfa(x=open_foam_copx_diff, q = -5:5, order = 1, scales=scales, scale_ratio=1.1)
```

```{r}

```

#### DFA and MFDFA Considerations

We recommend a few points of consideration here in using this function. One is to be sure to evaluate whether there are cross-over points in the log scale-log fluctuation plots [@pengMosaicOrganizationDNA1994; @perakakis2009]. Cross-over points (or a visible change in the slope as a function of scale) indicate that a mono-fractal characterization does not sufficiently characterize the data. If cross-over points are evident, we recommend proceeding to estimate the two scaling regions with a piece-wise regression.

While it is common to use only linear detrending with DFA, it is important to inspect the trends in the data to determine if it would be more appropriate to use a higher order polynomial for detrending, and/or compare the DFA output for different polynomial orders [@kantelhardtDetectingLongrangeCorrelations2001].

General recommendations for choosing the min and max scale are minimum scale of 10 and a maximum scale of N/4, where N is the total number of observations in the signal. See Eke et al. (2002) [@ekeFractalCharacterizationComplexity2002] and Gulich and Zunino (2014) [@gulichCriterionDeterminationOptimal2014] for additional considerations.

## Bivariate Methods

### Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis

Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA; @podobnikDetrendedCrossCorrelationAnalysis2008, @zebendeDCCACrosscorrelationCoefficient2011 ) is a bivariate extension of the DFA algorithm generalizing it to a correlational case between two time series that may be non-stationary. The key questions that can be asked with it are: a) *How does correlation between two time series change as a function of scale?* and b) *What is/are the dominant (time) scale(s) of coordination? (those that are beyond a threshold, or statistically significant given a criteria, or of a certain magnitude?* For DCCA, the DFA algorithm gets applied to both time series providing the scale-wise estimates for both. DESCRIBE DCCA ALGORITHM HERE. Whereas in DFA, the key metric is $\alpha$, in DCCA, one estimates the scale-specific, detrended cross-correlation coefficient $\rho$ for the pair of time series.

#### DCCA Examples

To demonstrate the use of `dcca()`, we used the `mc_arfima()` function from our package to simulate two time series with known properties. Specifically, we use the multicorrelated ARFIMA examples from Kristoufec's work [@kristoufekMixedcorrelatedARFIMAProcesses2013]. In this case, we use the parameters from Kristoufec (2013) for Model 1 (p. 6,487), that generates two time series of length 10,000 that exhibit long range correlations (LRC) as well as long range cross-correlations (LRCC). The code for simulating these two time series is shown below. Additionally, Figure #, shown below, visualizes a subset of these time series.

```{r message=FALSE}
set.seed(987345757)

sim1 <- mc_ARFIMA(process="Mixed_ARFIMA_ARFIMA", alpha = 0.2, beta = 1, gamma = 1, delta = 0.2, n = 10000, d1 = 0.4, d2 = 0.3, d3 = 0.3, d4=0.4, rho=0.9)

```

**Figure \#**

*Subset of two time series exhibiting long range correlation and long range cross-correlation*

```{r, echo=FALSE}

plot(sim1[2000:3000,1],type='l', ylab= "Signal Amplitude", xlab='Time', main = "MC-ARFIMA with LRC and LRCC")

lines(sim1[2000:3000,2], col='blue')
```

To perform the `dcca()` on these time series, we could use the code below, where we first define the `scales` using using the `logscale()` to define a set of logarithmically spaced scales to use for the analysis.

```{r}
scales <- logscale(scale_min = 10, scale_max = 1000, scale_ratio = 1.1)

dcca.out.arfima <- dcca(sim1[,1], sim1[,2], order = 1, scales = scales)
```

From here, we can visualize the output of the analysis as shown below in Figure #. We observe that, as expected, the correlation between the MC-ARFIMA processes are consistently high (all $\rho$'s $> .8$) and continue to be high at increasing time scales. We also add standard errors plotted around each point, but note these are based on one simulation only and more robust estimates of standard error could be calculated using many time series.

**Figure \#**

*DCCA output for long range correlation and long range cross-correlation*

```{r, echo=FALSE}

dcca.plot(dcca.out.arfima, order = 1, ci = FALSE, iterations = NULL, return.ci = FALSE)
#dcca.out.arfima <- as.data.frame(dcca.out.arfima)

#error <- sd(dcca.out.arfima$rho)/sqrt(length(dcca.out.arfima$rho))

#dcca.plot <- ggplot(data=dcca.out.arfima, aes(x=scales,y=rho)) + geom_point() +geom_line() + ggtitle("DCCA on MC-ARFIMA processes with LRC and LRCC")+ geom_pointrange(aes(ymin=rho-error,ymax=rho+error))

#geom_smooth(method=lm, formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), se = TRUE)

#dcca.plot
```

As a point of comparison, we can generate a time series in contrast with this that exhibits processes with LRC and short-range cross-correlation (SRCC) using the code below. In contrast to the previous DCCA analysis, Figure \# shows a signal that begins with a high cross-correlation ($\rho$'s $> .6$) , but that begins to deviate and trend substantially lower at increasing scale sizes approaching $\rho = 0$.

```{r}
sim2 <- mc_ARFIMA(process="Mixed_ARFIMA_AR", alpha = 1,beta = 1,gamma = 1,delta = 1,n =10000,d1=0.4,d2=0.4,theta1=0.8,theta2=0.8,rho=0.9)
```

**Figure \#**

```{r, echo=FALSE}

dcca.plot(dcca.out.arfima2, order = 1, ci = FALSE, iterations = NULL, return.ci = FALSE)

#error <- sd(dcca.out.arfima2$rho)/sqrt(length(dcca.out.arfima2$rho))

Turning next to the empirical balance data, we apply DCCA to the differenced COPx and COPy data for the firm and foam platforms. We again set appropriate values for `scales` and apply the `dcca()` function to the pairs of time series.

```{r echo=FALSE}
scales <- logscale(scale_min=16, scale_max=length(open_firm_copx_diff)/4,scale_ratio=1.1)

dcca.out.open.firm <- dcca(open_firm_copx_diff, open_firm_copy_diff, order = 1, scales = scales)

dcca.out.open.foam <- dcca(open_foam_copx_diff, open_foam_copy_diff, order = 1, scales = scales)

```

**Figure \#**

```{r echo=FALSE}
dcca.plot(dcca.out.open.firm, order = 1, ci = FALSE, iterations = NULL, return.ci = FALSE)

dcca.plot(dcca.out.open.foam, order = 1, ci = FALSE, iterations = NULL, return.ci = FALSE)

```

In examining the output from these analyses, Figure \# shows a clear difference between the two conditions. First, in the firm platform example, the $\rho$ values reach an order of magnitude greater than in the foam condition with the max $\rho$ = `r max(dcca.out.open.firm$rho)`' compared to `r max(dcca.out.open.foam$rho)` for the foam condition. In addition, we observe for the foam example, that the time scale of maximum correlation is `r dcca.out.open.firm$scales[which.max(dcca.out.open.firm$rho)]`, which is a larger time scale when compared to the foam example, which had a maximum correlation at scale r `dcca.out.open.foam$scales[which.max(dcca.out.open.foam$rho)]`. In addition, the pattern of change in correlation across scales is slightly different. Th firm example is higher overall, it starts relatively low at very small time scales before a rapid increase and then steady decrease before exhibiting some pseudo-periodic behavior at increasingly larger scales. By contrast, the foam example has relatively lower overall correlation values, the smallest scale is the highest followed by a steady decrease and then also some pseudo-periodic behavior at increasingly larger scales.

### Multi-scale Regression Analysis

Multi-scale regression analysis (MRA) is an adaptation of DCCA that brings the analyses into a predictive, regression framework @kristoufek2015 . The key questions that can be answered by it are: a) *How does the influence of one time series on another time series change as a function of scale?* and b) *What is/are the dominant (time) scale(s) of influence of one time series on another time series?* The algorithm is largely the same as DCCA, with a key difference being that instead of estimating scale-wise symmetric correlation coefficients, leveraging methods of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, asymmetric $\beta$ coefficients are estimated (see @likens2019; @kristoufek2015 ).

#### MRA Examples

Considering the LRC and LRCC simulations used for DCCA, we can examine whether the scale-wise fluctuations of one variable can predict the scale-wise fluctuations of the other using `mra()`. As with a traditional regression approach, we will use one of our variables as our predictor ($x_t$) and the other as our outcome ($y_t$). In the example below, we again first define our logarithmically spaced scales. We then apply the `mra()` function to the two simulated time series. In this case, it's important to specify which is variable is `x` (the predictor) and which is `y` (the outcome).

```{r}
scales <- logscale(scale_min = 10, scale_max = 1000, scale_ratio = 1.1)

mra.out <- mra(x = sim1[,1], y = sim1[,2],order = 1, scales = scales)
```

We can then visualize these results as shown below in Figure #. Generally, we observe that the $\beta$ coefficients are relatively stable at increasing time scales with a general, perhaps quadratically increasing trend. Here it is also important to investigate the change in $R^2$ as well as the $t$-values. Below we see that the $R^2$ is quite high at most of the time scales with $R^2_{min} =$ `r round(min(mra.out$r2),2)` and $R^2_{max} =$ `r round(max(mra.out$r2),2)` and all of the $t$-values greater than the conventional cut-off at 1.96. So between these two component ARFIMA processes, the output of MRA shows that much of the scale specific variance in $y_t$ is explained and predicted by $x_t$.

**Figure \#**

*MRA output for long range correlation and long range cross-correlation.*

```{r echo=FALSE}
mra.plot(mra.out)
#error <- sd(mra.out$betas)/sqrt(length(mra.out$betas))
#mra.plot <- ggplot(data=mra.out, aes(x=scales,y=betas)) + geom_point() +geom_line() +ggtitle("Multiscale Regression Analysis for MC-ARFIMA with LRC and LRCC") + geom_pointrange(aes(ymin=betas-error,ymax=betas+error))
#geom_smooth(method=lm, formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), se = TRUE)
#mra.plot
```

```{r warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
scales <- logscale(scale_min = 16, scale_max = length(open_firm_copx_diff)/4, scale_ratio = 1.1)

mra.firm.out.xy <- mra(open_firm_copx_diff, open_firm_copy_diff, order = 1, scales = scales)

mra.firm.out.yx <- mra(open_firm_copy_diff, open_firm_copx_diff, order = 1, scales = scales)
#open_foam_copx_diff, open_foam_copy_diff

```

Turning next to the empirical balance data, we can determine whether postural adjustments in the COPx are predictive of adjustments in COPy, and vice versa. This means that we use the `mra()` function two times and reverse the order of entry for the x and y arguments to allow for determining the degree to which each signal can predict the other across scales. In Figure \# below, we see the resulting $\beta$'s we observed for the the balance data on the firm surface. Notably, the COPx predicting COPy (max $\beta$ = `r max(mra.firm.out.xy$betas)`) has noticeably smaller $\beta$ values compared to COPy predicting COPx (max $\beta$ = `r max(mra.firm.out.yx$betas)`). Notice as well how Figure \# (bottom), where adjustments in the y dimension are predicting adjustments in the x dimension, resembles the DCCA plot for this analysis (see Figure \#). Given the assemtry in the magnitude of the $\beta$s, this example suggests that postural adjustments in the y dimension appear to be driving changes in the x dimension. And, there is a clear time scale where this relationship is strongest at scales = `r mra.firm.out.yx$scales[which.max(mra.firm.out.yx$betas)]`.

### Multi-scale Lagged Regression Analysis

Multi-scale lagged regression analysis is an extension of MRA that allows for examining the influence as a function of scale, but also of time lag. In particular, the key questions that can be asked with MLRA are: a) *How does the influence of one time series on another time series change as a function of scale at different time lags?* and b) *Does the dominant time scale of influence change over successive time lags?* DESCRIBE MLRA ALGORITHM HERE.

## Surrogate Methods

In all of the above methods, one gets either a single estimate of a parameter (e.g., $\alpha$) or a range of estimates (e.g., $\rho$, $\beta$). While those estimates are meaningful in and of themselves, it is common practice to perform some form of null hypothesis test regarding the estimate. These are generally referred to as surrogate methods @kantz2003 . We present several options here that could be ranked in terms of increasing levels of rigor: randomized surrogates, iterative amplitude adjusted Fourier transformed (IAAFT) surrogates, and model based surrogates.

### Randomized Surrogates

Randomized surrogates generally involve randomly shuffling the order of values of a time series. The idea is generally that the temporal structure is destroyed, yet the other features of the time series still exist [@kantelhardtMultifractalDetrendedFluctuation2002]. Note that additional options exist along these lines (see for example [@dumasInterBrainSynchronizationSocial2010]). The key comparison here would be to compare the estimates extracted from a given analysis (e.g., DFA) on the observed sample of data with the estimates derived from and equally sized sample of the surrogate series (see @kantz2003 @moulder2018 @wiltshire2019 for examples).

```{r}
rand.surr <- permute::shuffle(pink.noise)

dfa.rand.surr <- dfa(x = rand.surr, order = 1, verbose = 1, scales = scales, scale_ratio = 2)
```

Randomizing the pink noise time series, which originally exhibited long range correlation ($\alpha$ = `r dfa.pink$alpha`), and performing DFA on it, now provides an estimate of $\alpha$ = `r dfa.rand.surr$alpha`, which is consistent with a random or white noise process. These values are clearly different, however, performing inferential statistics on a sample of observed estimates compared to surrogate estimates would provide compelling evidence that the temporal dynamics suggested by the observed estimates are different than those derived from a random process.

### Iterative Amplitude-Adjusted Fourier Transform Surrogates (IAAFT)

The IAAFT algorithm was originally developed as a way to be able to evaluate, whether there is nonlinearity [@schreiber1996]. More recently, it was proposed as a technique that could be use to see whether multifractal indices suggest interaction across scales [@ihlen2010]. Like with randomized shuffling, estimates derived from IAAFT surrogates should be also be different from the estimates derived from the empirical time series. Although in this case, the comparison is typically made between the multifractal spectra of the observed time series, and the spectra from a set of IAAFT surrogate series.

In the code below, we provide an example for generating IAAFT surrogates using the `iaafft()` function in the package. One enters the `signal`, which is the observed time series, and `N`, the number of surrogates to generate. There are a number of options here but a common number of surrogates is 19 [@kantz2003]. Common practice is that surrogates are generated from many observed time series, but here we illustrate using only a single time series: the multifractal signal used previously in the MFDFA example. Then we use the same parameters for the `mfdfa()` function, but apply it to all of the IAAFFT surrogates.

```{r}

iaafft.surr <- iaafft(fractaldata$multifractal, N = 19)

iaafft.surr.out <- apply(iaafft.surr, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mfdfa, q = c(-5:5), order = 1, scales=scales)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# maybe there is a more efficient way to do this with apply?
for (i in 1:length(iaafft.surr.out)){
  mf.width.temp <- max(iaafft.surr.out[[i]]$h) - min(iaafft.surr.out[[i]]$h)
  if (i == 1){
    mf.width <- mf.width.temp
  } else {
    mf.width <- rbind(mf.width,mf.width.temp)
  }
}
```

Assuming we were using IAAFFT to compare the multifractal width ($W$) between the observed signal and the surrogate signals, recall that the observed widith was $W_{multi} =$ `r max(multi.mf.dfa.out$h) - min(multi.mf.dfa.out$h)`. Now, we can calculate the average multifractal width across all of the generated surrogates and we observe that $W_{surr} =$ `r mean(mf.width)`, which is narrower than the spectrum from the multifractal signal. In practice, there are many surrogate options [@moulder2018], but, again, inferential statistics are commonly performed to compare observed estimates to the surrogate estimates to bolster evidence of the inferred dynamics.

### Model-based Surrogates

-   Model based surrogate (Simulated exponents) - See Likens 2019 paper with model of postural sway/control, taking an educated guess about the data generating process underlying the time series. Estimates should not be different. See Roume et al 2018 windowed detrended CCA
-   Can we incorporate lags into MC-ARFIMA?

# Appendix 1: Fundamental Equations

Here we will insert the fundamental equations for showcasing the algorithms. WE NEED Lagged functions and MFDFA.

DFA

$F_X = \sqrt{\frac{\sum^{T-s+1}_{j-1}f^2_X(s,j)}{T-s}}$

where

$f^2_X(s,j) = \frac{\sum^{j+s-1}_{k=j}(X_k -\widehat{X}_{k,j})}{s-1}$

DCCA

$F_Y = \sqrt{\frac{\sum^{T-s+1}_{j-1}f^2_Y(s,j)}{T-s}}$

where

$f^2_Y(s,j) = \frac{\sum^{j+s-1}_{k=j}(Y_k -\widehat{Y}_{k,j})}{s-1}$

and the scale-wise covariance is estimated as:

$f^2_{XY}(s,j) = \frac{\sum^{j+s-1}_{k=j}(X_k -\widehat{X}_{k,j})(Y_k -\widehat{Y}_{k,j})}{s-1}$

which forms the basis for the scale-wise correlation coefficient estimated as:

$\rho(s) = \frac{F^2_{XY}(s)}{F_X(s)F_Y(s)}$

and for the multi-scale regression coefficients, we replace the denominator in the $\rho(s)$ equation with scale-wise variance of the predictor to estimate the scale-wise regression coefficient from regression $Y_t$ on $X_t$ as:

$\widehat{\beta}(s) = \frac{F^2_{XY}(s)}{F^2_X(s)}$

and where the variance of $\widehat{\beta}(s)$ is:

$\sigma_{\widehat{\beta}(s)}^2 = \frac{1}{T-2} \times \frac{F^2_u(s)}{F^2_Y(s)}$

and the scale-wise residual variance, $\widehat{F}^2_u(s)$ is estimated by applying the DFA algorithm to all scale-wise residuals, $\widehat{u}_t(s)$ as:

$\widehat{u}_t(s) = y_t - x_t\widehat{\beta}(s) - \overline{y_t - x_t\widehat{\beta}(s)}$
